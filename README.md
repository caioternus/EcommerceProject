- This project is a responsive e-commerce website for Nike sneakers which was developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS;

- The end user can view appearance and price for five selected sneaker models of the manufacturer: Air Force, Air Jordan, Blazer, Crater and Hippie;

- In the center of the top menu, the user has a slider tool to navigate between the five sneakers models. According to the button the user clicks on, the page will scroll down and automatically position the user in the prefered sneaker model;

- Furthermore, before proceeding with the shipping order, the user must inform the product size and color. There are two color options for each sneaker model (e.g. black or dark blue, light gray or green, gray or black - these availability of color options depend on the choosen sneaker model) as well as different size options (e.g. 41, 42 or 43);

- The end user has access to a "buy button" in which it is possible to insert credit card information for shipping;
