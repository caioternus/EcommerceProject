- This project is a responsive e-commerce webpage for Nike sneakers which was developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS;

- The end user can view appearance and price for five selected sneaker models of the manufacturer: Air Force, Air Jordan, Blazer, Crater and Hippie;

- In the center of the top menu, the user has a slider tool to navigate between the five sneakers models, and so according to the one the user selects, the page will scroll down and automatically position the user in the prefered sneaker model;

- Furthermore, there are two color options for each sneaker model (i.e. black or dark blue, light gray or green, gray or black - these availability of color options depend on the choosen sneaker model);

- The end user has access to a "buy button" in which it is possible to insert credit card information for shipping;
